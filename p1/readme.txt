In this project, you will develop a simple website using HTML and CSS. Your site
will simulate an online storefront for a fictitious business of your choice.

1. Determine your business name and product line.
2. Edit header.html to create a header to be displayed on every page of your site. Include links to home, about, and products.
3. Fill in the HTML head and the main body ("content" div) of your home page (index.html) and about.html pages.
4. Create a table of your products in products.html. Each row of the table should include a product name, a photo, and a link to order it.
5. Create an order form in order.html.
6. Add several styles to style.css to color and/or format site elements.
7. Add at least one HTML5 element to your site

You may modify or add to any of the existing html with the following exceptions:
1. Do not rename style.css or change the references to it.
2. Do not change the form action or method in order.html.
3. Do not change the name of the main page from index.html.
4. Do not repeat your header code across every page.
